# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
## Overview
All Kaggle learners are encouraged to participate in a machine learning competition called 'Titanic'. Participants are given a dataset on passengers which includes age, gender, marital status, and whether the passenger survived. 
Using this dataset, I've trained different machine learning models to predict passenger survival.

## Machine Learning Models Used:
1. Decision Tree - Accuracy Score: 0.770
2. XGBoost - Accuracy Score: 0.772
